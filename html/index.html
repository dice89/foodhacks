            Food{Hacks}’s goal is to bring together programmers, designers and industry experts to build disruptive and innovative digital prototypes for the food industry. To solve industry problems, different prototypes will be developed that might include: apps that help farmers to directly market their product, analyses of supply chains of large retailers, solutions to alleviate world hunger, or yet another innovative delivery service app.</p>
            <p>
                For potential partners the main benefit lies within the scouting of young and creative IT students or other digital natives who are able to tackle and solve problems with fresh ideas outside of typical thought patterns.

                    Getting fresh food to consumer in the fastest possible way allows us to have the greatest experience in the richness and freshness of what our planet has to offer. Of course this means a huge challenge from the farmer to the delivery service to have the greatest results. Get ready for 7 billion peoples wanted to have a good diary.

                Wouldn‘t it be great if we knew more about every detail we eat? Starting from the soil our vegetables have grown, to the farming conditions all over to what molecules are actually inside.
Wouldnt it be great for us to know what we still have to eat today and what ingredients we should not eat anymore?

                Never has humanity been so thankful to get instagram from all friends about their special dinner, which was most of the time some ordinary hamburger or salad.
Are we capable of come up with something better than a collective mass-sharing of food pics?

                When it comes to designing food, Chefs from all over the world come up with the most creative ideas.
What if technology helps us create new designs with existing food ressources? Fun fact: there was a project with 3D-printed cookies made from flour worms. A high protein insect delicacy.

                Ever touched a screen with in dough dripping fingers, because you needed to see your recipe app? 
Probably not, because you can‘t cook ;) But others have those and similar problems everyday and our technology is not prepared for this – yet.
What if we go much further than just thinking about how to communicate processing steps for preparation, but invent systems for automatic principles which are so simple every user can understand?
